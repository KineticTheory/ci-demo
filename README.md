Draco is an object-oriented component library geared towards
numerically intensive, radiation (particle) transport applications
built for parallel computing hardware.  It consists of
semi-independent packages and a robust build system.  The packages in
draco provide a set of components that can be used by multiple clients
to build transport codes.  The build system can also be extracted for
use in clients.
